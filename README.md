# Perlin Noise Visualiser

Uses the p5.js library to animate and handle the noise generation.

A couple of visualisations show what it can do:

- Perlin Looping - shown with a circle, where the ends line up in a perfect loop
- 2D noise - Choosing noise for every pixel in a 2d image
- Grid pattern - moving noise - animated noise looks like it is sliding in from the side of the screen
- Worm - a point moving in directions dictated by perlin noise, with a line traced behind it
- Wave - A continuous 1D line scrolling showing the effect of increasing the noise detail
